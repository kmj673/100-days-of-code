**Today's Progress**: I made a christmas banner with bubble effect background. and I learend how to put 'px' and 's' when it is in scrip. I also learned transform-origin and CSS :nth-child() Selector.

**Thoughts** the @keyframes is really useful for some animation that needs to be consistently moved.
